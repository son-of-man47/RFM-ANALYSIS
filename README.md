# RFM-ANALYSIS

RFM analysis is a customer segmentation method that categorizes customers based on their transaction history using three metrics: Recency (the time since their last purchase), Frequency (how often they buy), and Monetary Value (how much they spend). This approach helps businesses identify valuable, at-risk, and high-potential customers, allowing for targeted marketing efforts and improved strategies.  


### How RFM Analysis Works
1. Score Each Customer: Each customer is assigned a score (often on a scale of 1-5) for each of the three RFM factors, with higher scores indicating higher engagement or value in that category. 
2. Combine Scores: These scores are combined into a three-digit number (e.g., 555) representing the customer's RFM profile. 
3. Segment Customers: Based on their combined RFM scores, customers are grouped into different segments. 
4. Tailor Marketing: These segments then inform targeted marketing campaigns, such as offering discounts to at-risk customers or personalized recommendations to high-value ones. 


### The Three RFM Factors
1. Recency (R): How recently did the customer make a purchase?
A customer who purchased recently is considered more engaged and is more likely to purchase again. 

2. Frequency (F): How often does the customer purchase? 
Frequent buyers are typically more loyal and engaged with the brand. 

3. Monetary Value (M): How much has the customer spent? 
This metric identifies the most profitable customers.
